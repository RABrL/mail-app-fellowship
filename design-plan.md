# Design Plan

## Context and scope
Starting with this fellowship path, the program challenges us to create an email client, to evaluate and see our teamwork. 
As a team we have decided that we will first apply the necessary user stories and then we will be able to apply the other user stories.
## Goals
- The user will be able to send and receive emails to and from registered users in the database
- a sustainable and scalable data structure is going to be built.
- The user will be able to search an email by the subject or the sender
- The user will be able to see his sent and received emails
- The code will be documented

## No Goals
- The user wont be able to send or receive emails from users not registered on the platform or from other domains (gmail, outlook, etc...)
- Implementing advanced social media integration.
- Providing real-time chat functionality
